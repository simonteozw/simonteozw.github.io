Well, I finally got around to putting this website together. This is something I have wanted to do for some time now and I finally have the time to get it sorted out. This blog will host all my thoughts and musings about code, my Computer Science degree, and anything else I wish to write about. One neat thing about this website - it is powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com).
